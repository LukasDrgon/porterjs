Welcome to PorterJS
===================

Read through the `documentation`_ and check out our `demo`_.

You can get up and running by installing via ``npm``.

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install porterjs-framework

But, the only file you need is the resource, which you can get from `jsdelivr`_:

.. code-block:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/porterjs/1.0.1/porter.min.js"></script>

So, feel free do just download that one file.

This project is currently in active development. Please feel free to join as a tester, debugger, programmer, or drinking buddy.
