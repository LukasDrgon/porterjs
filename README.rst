Welcome to PorterJS
===================

Read through the `documentation`_ and check out our `demo`_.

You can get up and running by installing via ``npm``.

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install porter

But, the only file you need is the resource:

.. code-block:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/porter.min.js"></script>

So, feel free do just download that one file.

This project is currently in active development. Please feel free to join as a tester, debugger, programmer, or drinking buddy.
