Why PorterJS?
-------------

That's a good question. There are plenty of other *good* packages out there. Why another?

To be light. To be fast. To be powerful. To be easy to use.

For example, PorterJS does not ship with a templating engine. Out of the box, it does not do client side rendering. **HOWEVER**, it can be used with your favorite templating engine. `Handlebars`_ and `mustache.js`_ both plug in nicely. My personal favorite is `Markup.js`_.

Many JS frameworks out there require you to dive in and become an expert in their way of doing things. The goal for PorterJS is to alleviate that. It is meant to be developed to look and feel like plain old JavaScript and HTML, and to operate intuitively.

How can I help?
---------------

The project is still in active initial development with not all of its core features completed. However, enough is together to make it usable and operational. For any bugs, please let me know on the `GitHub page`_.

If you are interested in helping to debug, write documentation, test, develop, or just sit down and have a been together, let me know.
